# Note Types
One of the core features of Trilium is that it supports multiple types of notes, depending on the need.

## Creating a new note with a different type via the note tree

The default note type in Trilium (e.g. when creating a new note) is <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Text.md">Text</a>, since it's for general use.

To create a new note of a different type, head to the <a class="reference-link" href="Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and right click an existing note where to place the new one and select:

*   _Insert note after_, to put the new note underneath the one selected.
*   _Insert child note_, to insert the note as a child of the selected note.

## Creating a new note of a different type via add link or new tab

*   When adding a [link](Note%20Types/Text/Links.md) in a <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Text.md">Text</a> note, type the desired title of the new note and press Enter. Afterwards the type of the note will be asked.
*   Similarly, when creating a new tab, type the desired title and press Enter.

## Changing the type of a note

It is possible to change the type of a note after it has been created via the _Basic Properties_ tab in the <a class="reference-link" href="Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md">Ribbon</a>. Note that it's generally a good idea to change the note type only if the note is empty. Can also be used to edit the [source of a note](Advanced%20Usage/Note%20source.md).

## Supported note types

The following note types are supported by Trilium:

| Note Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Text.md">Text</a> | The default note type, which allows for rich text formatting, images, admonitions and right-to-left support. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Code.md">Code</a> | Uses a mono-space font and can be used to store larger chunks of code or plain text than a text note, and has better syntax highlighting. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Saved%20Search.md">Saved Search</a> | Stores the information about a search (the search text, criteria, etc.) for later use. Can be used for quick filtering of a large amount of notes, for example. The search can easily be triggered. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Relation%20Map.md">Relation Map</a> | Allows easy creation of notes and relations between them. Can be used for mainly relational data such as a family tree. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Note%20Map.md">Note Map</a> | Displays the relationships between the notes, whether via relations or their hierarchical structure. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Render%20Note.md">Render Note</a> | Used in <a class="reference-link" href="Scripting.md">Scripting</a>, it displays the HTML content of another note. This allows displaying any kind of content, provided there is a script behind it to generate it. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Collections.md">Collections</a> | Displays the children of the note either as a grid, a list, or for a more specialized case: a calendar.    <br>  <br>Generally useful for easy reading of short notes. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a> | Displays diagrams such as bar charts, flow charts, state diagrams, etc. Requires a bit of technical knowledge since the diagrams are written in a specialized format. |
| <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Types/Canvas.md">Canvas</a> | Allows easy drawing of sketches, diagrams, handwritten content. Uses the same technology behind [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com). |
