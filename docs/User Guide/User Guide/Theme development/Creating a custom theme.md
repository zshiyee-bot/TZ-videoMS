# Creating a custom theme
## Step 1. Find a place to place the themes

Organization is an important aspect of managing a knowledge base. When developing a new theme or importing an existing one it's a good idea to keep them into one place.

As such, the first step is to create a new note to gather all the themes.

## Step 2. Create the theme

## Step 3. Define the theme's CSS

As a very simple example we will change the background color of the launcher pane to a shade of blue.

To alter the different variables of the theme:

```css
:root {
	--launcher-pane-background-color: #0d6efd;
}
```

## Step 4. Activating the theme

Refresh the application (Ctrl+Shift+R is a good way to do so) and go to settings. You should see the newly created theme:

Afterwards the application will refresh itself with the new theme:

Do note that the theme will be based off of the legacy theme. To override that and base the theme on the new TriliumNext theme, see: [Theme base (legacy vs. next)](Customize%20the%20Next%20theme.md)

## Step 5. Making changes

Simply go back to the note and change according to needs. To apply the changes to the current window, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to refresh.

It's a good idea to keep two windows, one for editing and the other one for previewing the changes.
