## ⚠️ Why TriliumNext?

[The original Trilium project is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues/4620)

### Migrating from Trilium?

There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Trilium instance. Just upgrade your Trilium instance to the latest version and [install TriliumNext/Trilium as usual](#-installation)

Versions up to and including [v0.90.4](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/v0.90.4) are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of [v0.63.7](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7). Any later versions of TriliumNext have their sync versions incremented.
